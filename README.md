<h3>Introduction<h3/>

<p>
Hello, my name is Sean Thompson, and welcome to my Personal Website. I believe it’s an ideal platform for showcasing the progression through my time at the University of Oklahoma and allows me to showcase my capabilities to those who may be eager to evaluate me.
If you have found my site by accident, welcome and enjoy. To Adam and Micah, I hope the time and effort will show in my work that the goals I have set forth for myself will be worked towards, and hope you find my content interesting. I’d love to hear your feedback or thoughts.
  <p/>
